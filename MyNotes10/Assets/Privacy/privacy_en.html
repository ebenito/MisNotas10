    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 4, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>MisNotas10</strong>. This app is designed to help you manage your personal notes easily and securely. Below we explain how your information is handled.</p>

    <h2>1. Information collected by the app</h2>
    <p><strong>MisNotas10 does not collect, store, or share personal information</strong> with the developer or with third parties. All data created by the user is stored locally on the device.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of OneDrive</h2>
    <p>The app offers an optional feature to <strong>backup and restore</strong> your notes using your personal <strong>Microsoft OneDrive</strong> account.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to OneDrive is used only to save and retrieve a backup file containing your notes.</li>
        <li>The app does not access or view any other files or folders in your OneDrive.</li>
        <li>You can revoke this access at any time from your Microsoft account settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data security</h2>
    <p>Your notes are stored on your device or in your private OneDrive space. No data is transmitted to external servers or to the developer.</p>

    <h2>4. User rights</h2>
    <p>Since MisNotas10 does not collect personal data, it is not necessary to exercise rights of access, correction, or deletion. You have full control over your data directly within the app and through your OneDrive account.</p>
